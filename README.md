# A-Study-on-Movie-Ratings
A comprehensive study of factors affecting average movie ratings based on datasets from IMDb.

Our goal for this project is that we can identify the factors that correlate with film ratings so that we can guide filmmakers on what decisions they should make regarding the factors of their films so that they can maximize their film ratings. We also seek to benefit audience members with this plan by improving the quality of new film releases and giving audience members back the satisfying film-viewing experiences they used to have. Additionally, we could provide audience members a tool for gauging the quality of a film before release based on these factors. This would allow them to judge if the film is worth viewing and if it will be worth their time and money.
